	/* Interface:
->Interface variables will be inherited to subclasses
->interface is a keyword which is used to define user defined datatypes.
->interface can be used to achieve multiple inheritance in java.
->one interface can be extend one or more interface.
->one class can implement one or more interfaces.
->interface can contain the following members:
  1)public final static variables
  2)public abstract methods
  3)public static inner classes
->Variables declared in the interface are by default public final and static.
->Methods declared in the interface are by default public and abstract.
->we can have multiple default and static functions/methods in interface.
->we can't use normal complete function/methods(liks using void in method) in interface.



Key Features of Interfaces:
->No Implementation: Interfaces only declare methods, properties, or events.
 The implementation is done by the classes that implement the interface.
->Multiple Inheritance: Classes can implement multiple interfaces, even though they
 can inherit from only one class. This allows for more flexible code reuse and design.
->Abstraction: Interfaces provide a way to enforce abstraction. They hide the details
 of how functionality is implemented and expose only the required methods or properties.
->Polymorphism: Interfaces are commonly used in polymorphism, where different classes
 can be treated as instances of the interface they implement, allowing for more flexible 
 and scalable code.*/
