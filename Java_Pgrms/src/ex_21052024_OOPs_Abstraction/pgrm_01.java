/*Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details and
 showing only the functionality to the user. It allows you to focus on what 
 an object does instead of how it does it. By doing so, abstraction reduces complexity 
 and increases efficiency by enabling the developer to work on a higher level of 
 functionality without worrying about the underlying implementation.
 
 -->if we are creating abstract method we must create a abstract class, In that only 
 we can able to create a abstarct mentods.
 -->abstarct can be a both class or method.
 -->if class doesn't have any abstarct method then it is a concrete class

How to Achieve Abstraction:- using thse two key word abstract and interface we can achieve abstraction.
->Abstract Class: A class that contains at least one abstract method 
(a method without a body).
->Interface: A completely abstract class that only defines methods without 
any implementation. All methods in an interface are abstract by default.
->through interface we can achieve 100% abstarction.
